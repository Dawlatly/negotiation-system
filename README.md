# negotiation-system
Negotiation is a crucial part of any agreement that parties come to agree upon. Whether
it is between a buyer and seller discussing a business transaction, governments agreeing
upon a peace treaty, or even a settlement agreement in a lawsuit, negotiations are used
to help opposing parties come to an agreement by compromising their preferences to
make a deal happen.

This project presents an e-negotiation system that uses multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to automate the negotiation process between two parties. This is a negotiation system that uses multi-objective optimization to provide both parties with an optimal offer. It uses NSGA-II to optimize the offers received by the parties.
To run, just execute the file `main.py` using the Python command `python main.py`
